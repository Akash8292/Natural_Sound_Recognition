## Abstract
This repository presents a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model capable of classifying sounds into 10 distinct categories, covering nature sounds, human non-speech sounds, and more. The model boasts an impressive accuracy of 90% in achieving its classification task.The model operates by analyzing the processed spectrum of a WAV file, a two-dimensional representation of the sound's frequency content. Based on the processed data, the model predicts the corresponding sound category.This repository offers a clear and concise overview of a sound classification system utilizing RNNs, potentially serving as a valuable resource for those interested in exploring this field.
The repository consists of 4 key files, with the Natural_Sound_Recognition.ipynb housing the implementation code of the model and also facilitating the conversion of the WAV file into a spectrogram. Additionally, the requirements.txt file contains the necessary dependencies to run the model, while the instructions.txt provides detailed guidance for comprehending the repository's contents and utility. This comprehensive repository not only showcases the capabilities of RNNs in sound classification but also serves as a practical guide for individuals interested in exploring and implementing similar systems.
